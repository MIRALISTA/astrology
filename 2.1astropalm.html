            <h2>✡ Astrology and Palmistry ✡</h2>
            <p>There are lots of common misconceptions about astrology and palmistry that they are about
                fortune-telling. But it is absolutely not true! The words “palmistry” and “astrology” are scientific
                terms and they are translated as the "science of the hand" and the "science of the stars". Events in the
                life of any person are not accidental, it is a chain of interrelated events, causes and consequences.
                Astrological forecasts are based on accurate mathematical calculations of the movement of heavenly
                bodies and their influence on human life. Palmistry is based on thousands of years of research on human
                palms. The condition of hills, lines on your hands shows the character, opportunities and events in a
                person's life.</p>
            <p>These 2 beautiful sciences can read fate to help a person to choose their way of life and
                overcome difficulties. Don not miss the opportunity to use the knowledge of astrology and palmistry to understand yourself, to heal, to break free of
                your conditioning and chase your dreams.</p>

            <h2>✡ Combination of Astrology and Palmistry ✡</h2>
            <p> As we mentioned above astrology is the science which means that the actual success of reading a
                horoscope card completely depends on the correct calculation. In order to get accurate horoscope you need to
                know the place of your birth, exact date and time of birth (preferably the exact minute (that can be
                quite difficult sometimes for any reasons)). We make predictions in people's personal lives, describe
                their personalities, and give them advice all according to the position of astronomical bodies.
            </p>
            <p> In our work we use astrology as the main tool to explain aspects of a person's personality and predict
                significant events in their lives. So our reports are mostly based on the science of the stars. Also we use
                palmistry, but as an additional instrument, which gives us the opportunity to get even more accurate data
                about a person.</p>

            <h2>✡ How to take a picture of your palm? ✡</h2>
            <p> We often get questions about how to take a picture of the palm. It must be a close-up shot, all the
                lines on the palm should be well selected. In order to get good shots you need use some tricks.</p>
            <p>Use a good digital camera. You also need to set a maximum frame size of at least 1500 to 2300 pixels,
                but the higher the better.
                And even better, go to a professional photographer and explain that you need clear pictures of the
                palms. Preferable photo should be shot in the afternoon when there’s natural light. Set the macro mode
                on your camera (it is usually depicted as a flower). This mode is designed
                specifically to shoot the object closely, and it allows you to achieve sharp images.</p>
            <p>It is better to turn off the flash, because if you take photos using it, the lines can be illuminated.
                But in order to get a shot as clear as possible perform a day-time session.You can do this near a
                window. Under the arm it is desirable to put a piece of cloth or paper – which would give a uniform
                background and shaded lines on the hands.</p>
            <p>Little tricks. If you have dry skin on the palms and the lines are rough and not very clear, before
                shooting you can use fast absorbing hand cream (but use just small amount not to make it too shiny!).
            </p>
            <p>If it is not possible to take clear pictures at all, you can gently grind the pencil lead, and then rub
                this graphite dust in the palm of your hand. It’ll well set off the palm lines, because the surface of
                the hand will be dark, and the lines will remain white. But in such cases, you also need the photo of
                clean palm in order to assess the color and other
                indicators that can be seen only on clean skin. You can try to set off foundation powder.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contuct us.</p>
