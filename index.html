            <h2>✡ Saturn influence in 2019 ✡</h2>
            <p>
                We would like to share some the observations. In early 2019 we notice that our clients and
                acquaintances faced to situations which are connected with the past or a desire to drastically
                change their life. We can explain this by the fact that Saturn conjunction the South Node
                happened in April 2019. Such a situation may mean that you can leave something in the past. The
                old reality can go away, and we can say goodbye to something important.There can be a feeling of
                anxiety, fatigue, loneliness, apathy and indifference.
            </p>
            <p>
                ️ The things, which had brought pleasure before, now can cause irritation. A clear understanding of
                the fact that it is impossible to continue in this mode can appear. There can be a feeling that time
                is wasted and there is an urgent need to change something.
                Saturn is primarily responsible for professional activities. There may be senior government
                positions associated with a high level of of personal responsibility. This can be an area where a
                person has gained tremendous experience, and which they spent a lot of time for, and as a result
                they become successful in their careers. Also we can observe the tendency when people who are true
                professionals can be fired (even, perhaps, main figures in a business). On the other side,
                incompetent and irresponsible people can take their place. So many people in 2019 will quit or
                change their jobs.
            </p>
            <p> Signs such as Capricorn, Leo, Aquarius, and Cancer can be affected strongly this period. The desire
                to close the door to the old reality will be especially noticeable for them.
            </p>
            </p> The planet Saturn located in a certain house of the horoscope for every person. Each house is
            responsible for a specific area of ​​life. Thus in what exact area changes can happen will depend on
            where Saturn is located in a natal chart. Someone may quit their annoying work, others can stop their
            relationships or change their country of residence.

            <h2>✡ Saturn opposition ✡</h2>
            <p>
                Saturn is responsible for the time and for the sense of time. Retrograde Saturn in Capricorn often
                gives a feeling of dislike. Saturn is responsible for the skeleton, joints, teeth, skin and hair on
                the physical plane. Therefore, the risk of fractures increases during periods of tense aspects with the
                participation of Saturn. ️Saturn is the planet which formes tense aspects to its natal position and
                creates so-called age crises, dividing our life into specific periods. The first square of Transiting Saturn
                opposing natal Saturn (the Saturn opposition) one is about 7 years old. When a child after a loyal
                kindergarten and a relaxed home environment goes to school, they face to new daily activities,
                responsibilities, duties and a strict daily routine. The features of Saturn are system, discipline,
                restrictions, planning and deprivation. Psychologists testify that when a child enters school, he/she feel stress
                which is comparable to the state of an adult when flying into space.
            </p>
            <p>
                ️The task for adults is not only to support a child during this period, but also try to
                prepare kids for this period: teach them playfully to understand time (hours, minutes and calendar️). It
                is the good idea to make up beautiful (fun) daily routine with colorful pictures. Then a child will
                be happy to pick up and paste the appropriate pictures️. At this time, it is good to entrust to them
                (namely, to entrust (as a person already matured) - and not to obligate) some household duties. Share
                your experience with a child: how did you overcome the difficulties and treated defeats.
            </p>
            <p>The second age crisis (of Saturn opposition) falls on about 14 years. It is quite significant
                age. The communication with peers, rethinking of values ​​and the assimilation of social norms are
                very essential this time. Peer assessment is becoming more important than teachers and parents. An
                independent knowledge of world and its structure and laws begins. Training can not be done smoothly and
                painlessly, because we can assimilate our own experience only. The Saturn opposition in the horoscope of
                a teenager symbolizes their opposition to society and to the existing order. Teenagers can be oppressed by the feeling that everything and everyone are
                outdated. They believe that it is time not only to change everything, but to literally blow up the
                existing order. This can cause the rebellion in the form of thundering music, outrageous behavior and
                shocking clothing. The teenager tries to prove they are already an adult, and it results in the
                desire for independence, romantic relationships, drinking alcohol, smoking and joining informal groups.
            </p>
            <p>The Saturn opposition can be demonstrated in a different way in the life of a teenager.
                Sometimes, the  opposition causes a blockage of energy, which can lead to an unwillingness to communicate
                with someone and even fear of contact with people. And it depends on a teenager and their close people
                how well they will learn the lessons of Saturn.</p>
            </p>The Saturn opposition checks how well a person has mastered the system of the surrounding
            world and if they have learned to build relationships with people, how they are able to overcome
            difficulties. In this situation, parents can only be patient and remember themselves in adolescence: what
            feelings they had, what they worried about and afraid of. It is important to show wisdom, have patience for
            parents this time and to be sure that this period will definitely pass.</p>

            <h2>✡ Lunar eclipse on January 21, 2019 ✡</h2>
           <p> January is the important month of 2019, when there is a change of cycles. A moon eclipse will occur on the axis of the lion Leo/ Aquarius in the 1° of Leo on January 21. This
                eclipse sums up and completes the previous 1.5 annual cycle. The past lunar eclipse took place on
                27.07.2018, and some events could begin to occur even then. Now there is a final completion of the
                summer themes. Uranus will form a square to the Sun-Moon axis, which will give the lunar eclipse an effect of surprise
                - something obsolete will be destroyed, something will be renewed, and something will lose its meaning.                </p>
            
            <p> The people who have planets in the 1°of Leo, Aquarius, Taurus or Scorpio in their horoscope will be
                particularly sensitive to this lunar eclipse. Also the eclipse will affect people born from July 20 to
                26, from October 20 to 26, from January 17 to 23, from April 17 to 23.
                 The eclipse will push a person to change in various areas - whether they want or not. There may be a
                change in life style or a collapse of plans. Such an eclipse can bring financial losses. Therefore it is
                better not to plan purchases, investments and various financial transactions for the period close to the
                eclipse.
            </p>
            <p>This eclipse creates a very intense emotional background. Bursts of irritation and psychological
                instability and instability will be possible.Cardiovascular and nervous systems are vulnerable. It is better to avoid any abdominal operations during
                this period, because they can not only fail to produce the planned results, but also cause harm.
                You also need to be careful with electricity. And special attention should be paid to children</p>
