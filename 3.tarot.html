                    <h2>✡ Why Tarot Reading? ✡</h2>
            <p>Tarot readings are a powerful form of divination that use an ancient deck of cards to help you find
                answers
                to your most important questions about love, relationships, your career, finances and more. Psychics and
                fortune tellers have used Tarot cards for hundreds of years, and Trusted Tarot will give you an accurate
                reading that's personalized based the cards you choose and the order you pick them. Every card has a
                different meaning depending on its position, so you will get a unique and detailed perspective on your
                current situation.</p>

            <h2>✡ History of Tarot Reading ✡</h2>
            <p>The history of Tarot cards reading is as mystic as the concept of Tarot reading itself! Although there is
                no exact origin of Tarot history, there has been evidence that it was primitively known as a card game
                having a French title Le Tarots and was predominantly of Italian origin. However, it may well be noted that this
                game  is still played in some European countries but bears no resemblance to the divinity personified concept
                of Tarot reading. So Tarot cards can well be considered as a tool for effective divination solutions that have been
                consistently used since times immemorial.</p>
            <p> The importance of tarot symbolism was attached by the first psychologist, Carl Jung. He may have regarded
                the tarot cards by representing archetypes: situations embedded in the subconscious of all human being or
                fundamental types of person. The archetypes theory is used in several psychological treatments.</p>
            
            <h2>✡ Love Tarot Readings ✡</h2>
            <p>This kind of Tarot Readings are probably the most popular. You meet somebody and
                want to find out if their intentions are honorable or you are in a relationship that is getting a bit sour
                and you want to find out your chances of saving it. If you have doubts about your current love relationship or want to find out if the prospect you have in mind is a good match — love tarot reading can provide some
                meaningful answers for you.</p>

            <p>Remember that no matter what the reading reveals — you are able to influence the outcome
            of any situations. Tarot readings will show you the current state within the energetic frames of people
            involved.</p>
