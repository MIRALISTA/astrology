                <h2>✡ Saturn influence in 2019 ✡</h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to share some the observations. In early 2019 we notice that our clients and
                    acquaintances faced to situations which are connected with the past or a desire to drastically
                    change their life. We can explain this by the fact that Saturn conjunction the South Node 
                    happened in April 2019. Such a situation may mean that you can leave something in the past. The
                    old reality can go away, and we can say goodbye to something important.There can be a feeling of
                    anxiety, fatigue, loneliness, apathy and indifference.

                </p>
                <p>
                    ️ The things, which had brought pleasure before, now can cause irritation. A clear understanding of
                    the fact that it is impossible to continue in this mode can appear. There can be a feeling that time
                    is wasted and there is an urgent need to change something.
                    Saturn is primarily responsible for professional activities. There may be senior government
                    positions associated with a high level of of personal responsibility. This can be an area where a
                    person has gained tremendous experience, and which they spent a lot of time for, and as a result
                    they become successful in their careers. Also we can observe the tendency when people who are true
                    professionals can be fired (even, perhaps, main figures in a business). On the other side,
                    incompetent and irresponsible people can take their place. So many people in 2019 will quit or
                    change their jobs.
                </p>
                <p> Signs such as Capricorn, Leo, Aquarius, and Cancer can be affected strongly this period. The desire
                    to close the door to the old reality will be especially noticeable for them.
                </p>
                </p> The planet Saturn located in a certain house of the horoscope for every person. Each house is
                responsible for a specific area of ​​life. Thus in what exact area changes can happen will depend on
                where Saturn is located in a natal chart. Someone may quit their annoying work, others can stop their
                relationships or change their country of residence.

                    <p>
                        Saturn is responsible for the time and for the sense of time. Retrograde Saturn in♑ often
                        gives a
                        feeling of dislike. Saturn is responsible for the skeleton, joints, teeth, skin and hair on
                        the physical
                        plane. Therefore, the risk of fractures increases during periods of tense aspects with the
                        participation
                        of Saturn. ️Saturn is the planet which formes tense aspects to its natal position and
                        creates so-called
                        age crises, dividing our life into specific periods. The first square of Transiting Saturn
                        opposing
                        natal Saturn (the Saturn opposition) one is about 7 years old. When a child after a loyal
                        kindergarten
                        and a relaxed home environment goes to school, they face to new daily activities,
                        responsibilities,
                        duties and a strict daily routine. The features of Saturn are system, discipline,
                        restrictions, planning
                        and deprivation. Psychologists testify that when a child enters school, he/she feel stress
                        which is
                        comparable to the state of an adult when flying into space.

                    <p>
                        ️The task for adults is not only to support a child during this period, but also try to
                        prepare kids
                        for this period: teach them playfully to understand time (hours, minutes and calendar️). It
                        is the
                        good idea to make up beautiful (fun) daily routine with colorful pictures. Then a child will
                        be happy to
                        pick up and paste the appropriate pictures️. At this time, it is good to entrust to them
                        (namely, to
                        entrust (as a person already matured) - and not to obligate) some household duties. Share
                        your
                        experience with a child: how did you overcome the difficulties and treated defeats.

                    <p>The second age crisis (of Saturn opposition) falls on about 14 years. It is quite significant
                        age. The
                        communication with peers, rethinking of values ​​and the assimilation of social norms are
                        very essential
                        this time. Peer assessment is becoming more important than teachers and parents. An
                        independent
                        knowledge of world and its structure and laws begins. Training can not be done smoothly and
                        painlessly,
                        because we can assimilate our own experience only. The Saturn opposition in the horoscope of
                        a teenager symbolizes their opposition to society and to the
                        existing order. Teenagers can be oppressed by the feeling that everything and everyone are
                        outdated.
                        They believe that it is time not only to change everything, but to literally blow up the
                        existing
                        order. This can cause the rebellion in the form of thundering music, outrageous behavior and
                        shocking
                        clothing. The teenager tries to prove they are already an adult, and it results in the
                        desire for
                        independence, romantic relationships, drinking alcohol, smoking and joining informal groups.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Saturn opposition can be demonstrated in a different way in the life of a teenager.
                        Sometimes, the
                        opposition causes a blockage of energy, which can lead to an unwillingness to communicate
                        with someone
                        and even fear of contact with people. And it depends on a teenager and their close people
                        how well they
                        will learn the lessons of Saturn.</p>
                    </p>The Saturn opposition checks how well a person has mastered the system of the surrounding
                    world and if
                    they have learned to build relationships with people, how they are able to overcome
                    difficulties. In
                    this situation, parents can only be patient and remember themselves in adolescence: what
                    feelings they
                    had, what they worried about and afraid of. It is important to show wisdom, have patience for
                    parents
                    this time and to be sure that this period will definitely pass.</p>

            <h2>✡ Palmistry and astrology ✡</h2>
            There are lots of common misconceptions about astrology and palmistry that they are about
            fortune-telling.
            But it is absolutely not true! The words “palmistry” and “astrology” are scientific terms and they are
            translated as the science of the hand and the science of the stars. Events in the life of any person are
            not
            accidental, it is a chain of interrelated events, causes and consequences. Astrological forecasts are
            based
            on accurate mathematical calculations of the movement of celestial bodies and their influence on human
            life.
            Palmistry is based on thousands of years of research on human palms. Both of these beautiful science can
            read fate to help to choose his way of life and overcome difficulties.
