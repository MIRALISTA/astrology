                    <h2>✡ Capricorn ✡</h2>
                    <p>
                        Saturn, which is ruling planet for the Capricorn, can tell us a lot about the qualities of this
                        horoscope sign. Capricorn can be described in several words: rules, boundaries, frames, controls
                        and discipline. All Capricorns have an amazing quality - in their youth they feel older than
                        their peers. However when is in their mature years, they suddenly realize that their peers have
                        matured and aged, but Capricorn still remaines young. </p>
                    <p>The early years are often difficult and full of struggle for them. Capricorn adults are very
                        serious, practical, agile and stubborn in achieving their goal. They are very disciplined and
                        require the same from others. Capricorn are professionals in what they do,
                        but they can be terribly meticulous and boring. They can bring freedom-loved and informal
                        Aquarius or Sagittarius to a nervous tic, while not paying attention to their feelings, because
                        the rules exist to follow them! </p>
                    <P> Capricorns are prudent, economical (these qualities even can turn into greed). Luxurious life is
                        not for Capricorn.
                        They love such a lifestyle in order to have a stable, may be small, but guaranteed income. They
                        will not take a risk, because it can undermine their material well-being. Therefore, they can
                        refuse from good business offers and misses their chance, because they are afraid of losing what
                        they have. They achieve their goals working hard. They set tasks for themselves that can only be
                        solved independently by themselves. The more complicated the goal, the more determined and
                        active they are in order to reach it.</p>
                    <p>All mental emotions and impulses of Capricornare under strict control. They often have the lack
                        of sensuality and tenderness. Capricorn has all these qualities, but they don't demonstrate them
                        for public - they have such a nature. They are often shy and sensitive people inside who can suddenly fall
                        into melancholy, succumb to despair, depression. And they compensate for the lack of sensuality
                        with loyalty and reliability.</p>
                    <p> Capricorns are good friends. However if they are fall in love, they will choose the relationship.
                        Capricorns are ready to help and give practical advice. They respect their parents, respect old people
                        and appreciate their life experience. The description of Capricorn would be incomplete if we don't
                        mention their extremely conservative outlook on life. Any change in status, lifestyle, place of
                        residence, work scares them inexpressibly. Therefore, Capricorn always tries to follow to a given rhythm
                        of life and not to look for something new. As the result, it means that it is simply impossible
                        to make them believed in that fact that their way of life is wrong for any reasons.</p>
