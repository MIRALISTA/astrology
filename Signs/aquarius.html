            <h2>✡ Aquarius ✡</h2>
            <p>
                She symbol of Aquarius is a man holding 2 jars of living and dead water. Water is sensitivity
                and mysticism. Another symbol of Aquarius is a woman carrying a jug. It is impossible to exist
                without water, and this sign represents the inexhaustible source of life. Probably, the main
                idea of the
                mission of Aquarius is to bring a fresh stream in our life.</p>
            <p>The air is the element of Aquarius, which determines a significant mental activity. Aquarius are
                mostly able to learn easily. They usually are smart and love ancient history, philosophy, mysticism and
                astrology. Aquarius highly support tolerance and complete freedom. They can be very vinegarish
                when express their opinion. Aquarius have absolute, impenetrable confidence in their own right, it is
                almost impossible to change their mind. Despite the fact that Aquarius are very sociable, they are not
                flexible </p>
            <P> Aquarius sign unusually combines the patience, and conservatism of Saturn and the innovative spirit,
                futurism and adventurism of Uranus. Uranus is a planet of space, science, aviation and technical
                revolutions. So Aquarius often work in these fields. Aquarius is good at shocking people and making experiments. They run far ahead of their time
                shocking others. Aquarius is heralds of the future.They are amazing forecasters and always
                generate new ideas.</p>
            <p> It is important for Aquarius to have a company of like-minded people and friends. They are able to unite
                others to transfer their ideas into reality. You should never push Aquarius telling them: “you must”. If
                you say this to Aquarius, they are most likely run away from you. The word “must” causes hysteria for Aquarius. The principle of voluntariness is
                very important for them. Aquarius can seem crazy, unpredictable, incomprehensible to many people, but
                you definitely won't be bored with them.
