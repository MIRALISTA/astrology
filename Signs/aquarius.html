                    <h2>✡ Aquarius ✡</h2>
                    <p>
                        She symbol of Aquarius is a man holding 2 jars of living and dead water. Water is sensitivity
                        and mysticism. Another symbol of Aquariusis a woman carrying a jug. It is impossible to exist
                        without water, and this sign represents the inexhaustible source of life. Probably, the main
                        idea of the
                        mission of Aquarius is to bring a fresh stream in our life.</p>
                    <p>The air is the element of Aquarius, which determines a significant mental activity. Aquarius are
                        mostly able to learn easily. They usually are smart and love ancient history, philosophy, mysticism and
                        astrology. Aquarius highly support tolerance and complete freedom. They can be very vinegarish
                        when express their opinion. Aquarius have absolute, impenetrable confidence in their own right, it is
                        almost impossible to change their mind. Despite the fact that Aquarius are very sociable, they are not
                        flexible </p>
                    <P> Aquarius sign unusually combines the patience, and conservatism of Saturn and the innovative spirit,
                        futurism and adventurism of Uranus. Uranus is a planet of space, science, aviation and technical
                        revolutions. So Aquarius often work in these fields.
                        Aquarius are good at shocking people and making experiments. They run far ahead of their time
                        shocking others. Aquarius are heralds of the future.They are amazing forecasters and always
                        generate
                        new ideas.</p>
                    <p> It is important for Aquariusto have a company of like-minded people and friends. They are able to unite
                        others to transfer their ideas into reality. You should never push Aquarius telling them: “you must”. If you say this to Aquarius, they are most likely
                        run away from you. The word “must” causes hysteria for Aquarius. The principle of voluntariness is
                        very important for them. Aquarius can seem crazy, unpredictable, incomprehensible to many people, but you definitely won't be bored with them.
