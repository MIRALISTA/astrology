                    <h2>✡ Scorpio ✡</h2>
                    <p>
                        Scorpio is one of the most discussed horoscope signs, because it is linked with the most contradictory
                        energy and concepts such as rebirth and death, psychology and extreme, magic and sex. Scorpio is
                        like legendary phoenixes that can rise from the ashes and get out of crises even stronger than they
                        had been before. They are characterized by depth, vitality, amazing intuition and ability to make an influence
                        on masses. That is why Scorpio usually are excellent investigators and psychologists and
                        stuntmen. Their negative feature is that they are too suspicious, do not trust anyone, sometimes even
                        themselves.</p>
                    <p>in astrology Scorpios are divided into 3 types: “spiders”, “eagles” and “doves”. This is 3 stages of
                        Scorpio's spiritual development. The spiders is quite aggressive and stings first. The main emotion
                        which feeds on the tarantula is impotent hatred of its victims. Eagle will not attack first, it
                        will protect their loved ones from any enemy who it will be ruthless with.
                        The third, the highest stage of development is the dove (of the world). This is a person who does
                        not have any evil in him and therefore is transparent for any aggression and protected from it.
                        That is why both the most highly spiritual people and the most notorious villains, despots and
                        tyrants can be met among </p>
                    <P>If you want to change, contact Scorpio. Scorpio is the sign that can transform another sign of
                        the zodiac. Scorpio women don't ask permission to invade personal space and start digging. And they can get to the
                        depths very quietly. Scorpio hates to change themselves. They have a great inner desire to
                        withdraw into themselves, to acquire a stable position, so that their inner world is not touched. Scorpio
                        have amazing power combined with enormous vulnerability. They show high intensity in everything.
                        Scorpio do not like their and others ' weaknesses, but can be generous, sympathized. Scorpio are
                        rack, tough, lasts until the end, indomitable. </P>

                    <p>There are many athletes, businessmen, financial directors among Scorpios. Scorpio needs drive,
                        danger of any kind (even emotional). They struggle all their lives with their passions. And severe
                        struggle can cause health (nerves) problems.
                    </p>
                    <p>The support of Scorpio is thinking, information, the desire to know all the secrets of the world.
                        Scorpio tend to independence, freedom. They will not remain silent. They will be rebels and often reject
                        traditions. Suspicion, sarcasm, irony, the ability to see what is hidden under the shell – all
                        this qualities are also presented in this sign. Developed Scorpio is a born psychologist and
                        mystic.
