            <h2>✡ Scorpio ✡</h2>
            <p>
                Scorpio is one of the most discussed horoscope signs, because it is linked with the most contradictory
                energy and concepts such as rebirth and death, psychology and extreme, magic and sex. Scorpio is
                like legendary phoenixes that can rise from the ashes and get out of crises even stronger than they
                had been before. They are characterized by depth, vitality, amazing intuition and ability to make an
                influence on masses. That is why Scorpios usually are excellent investigators and psychologists and
                stuntmen. Their negative feature is that they are too suspicious, do not trust anyone, sometimes even
                themselves.</p>
            <p>In astrology Scorpios are divided into 3 types: “spiders”, “eagles” and “doves”. This is 3 stages of
                Scorpio's spiritual development. The spiders is quite aggressive and stings first. The main emotion
                which feeds on the tarantula is impotent hatred of its victims. Eagle will not attack first, it
                will protect their loved ones from any enemy who it will be ruthless with.
                The third, the highest stage of development is the dove (of the world). This is a person who does
                not have any evil in him and therefore is transparent for any aggression and protected from it.
                That is why both the most highly spiritual people and the most notorious villains, despots and
                tyrants can be met among </p>
            <p>If you want to change, contact Scorpio. Scorpio is the sign that can transform another sign of
                the zodiac. Scorpio women don't ask permission to invade personal space and start digging. And they can
                get to the depths very quietly. Scorpio hates to change themselves. They have a great inner desire to
                withdraw into themselves, to acquire a stable position, so that their inner world is not touched.
                Scorpios  have amazing power combined with enormous vulnerability. They show high intensity in everything.
                Scorpios do not like their and others'  weaknesses, but can be generous, sympathized. Scorpios are
                rack, tough, lasts until the end, indomitable. </p>

            <p>There are many athletes, businessmen, financial directors among Scorpios. Scorpio needs drive,
                danger of any kind (even emotional). They struggle all their lives with their passions. And severe
                struggle can cause health (nerves) problems.
            </p>
            <p>The support of Scorpio is thinking, information, the desire to know all the secrets of the world.
                Scorpios tend to independence, freedom. They will not remain silent. They will be rebels and often reject
                traditions. Suspicion, sarcasm, irony, the ability to see what is hidden under the shell – all
                this qualities are also presented in this sign. Developed Scorpio is a born psychologist and
                mystic.
