                    <h2>✡ Virgo ✡</h2>
                    <p>
                        Virgo is a melancholic person. The sign belongs to the element of earth, and its ruling
                        planet is Mercury. At the first sight, it can be considered that the Virgo’s most important
                        concerns are their home and material problems. In fact, this is not like that. Just Virgo’s
                        observing allows them to note all the imperfections of the surrounding world and correct them as
                        much as they can. Virgo always looks for knowledge. As a true Mercurian, they just need a
                        partner, Virgo can not be alone. Therefore, they can be very easy in a relationship, but
                        periodically taking out the brain.
                    </p> 
                       <p>They are very reliable persons. Virgo always thinks and analyzes
                        something. works a lot, sometimes even too much. If they come to visit their friend, they can
                        help washing floors, just because Virgin likes cleanliness. </p>                                              
                    <p>They can decide to make  experiments only after careful research, making a good plan, and checking. They are modest but
                        know their worth. They have logical attitude towards reality, that is why they can criticise
                        others reasonably, but without tolerance. They are quite sensitive to criticism, especially if
                        it is not fully substantiated. They can afford some luxury only at when no one sees. </p>
                    <P>In a professional sense, they always feel right in their place. Everywhere they work hard. They
                        have good ability to understand the essence of the matter. They are attentive, diligent,
                        economical. They are perfect leaders and work a lot as well. Virgo does not like to delegate
                        work to others, because they are sure that nobody will be able to do it better than Virgo can,
                        and this can scare people off.</P>

                    <p>Most of them have problems with awareness of their sexuality. The problem is that the Virgo
                        sees their own shortcomings too clear and very often consider themselves unworthy of the love or
                        attention of other persons. It is quite common, that Virgo can suffer from an inferiority
                        complex. Practical advice: Change your mind- praise yourself, love yourself and think less about
                        annoying trifles.
