            <h2>✡ Gemini ✡</h2>
            <p>
                The ruling planet for the Gemini sign is Mercury. In Roman mythology, Mercury (or Hermes)
                personifies the god of trade, profit and travel and also thieves. They always have inner
                requirement to do any activity. They constantly get new ideas, plans, always need to go
                somewhere, call somewhere, talk with someone about their plans - otherwise they are bored and
                may become depressed.In communication they are free and easy. They often change their minds.
                What they say and think today may not match tomorrow. They think that life is an adventure and
                they can get calmer only closer to 50 y.o.
            </p>
            <p> The element of Air for Gemini influences on their irresistible desire to communicate with and
                connect to other people. When they feel the lack of information, they begin to get bored, look
                for a new source of information until they find it.
                So the communicability of Gemini is their main feature. No other sign can communicate better
                than Gemini. Gemini is called a "mirror" of the Zodiac, because they can reflect any person in
                communication, that's why everyone likes to communicate with them. But Gemini is always behind
                the scenes. It's hard to understand what's on their mind. In communication they are the center
                and soul of the any group of friends.</p>
            <p> A typical Gemini is an omnipresent person. Catching Gemini on something is extremely difficult,
                they are able to get out of any situation. They are family people, because the force is their
                family. From the point of view of astrology, the best husbands are Gemini and Virgo.</P>

            <p>Gemini usually has very skillful and agile hands (even the symbol is two sticks). The ruling
                planet Mercury is responsible for this part of the body. That is why amongst them there are so
                many make-up artists, designers and of course, leading and journalists are gemini.
                If we talk about countries under the sign of Gemini, then this is the USA. There are no more
                mobile, more sociable, friendly and easy people in the world than Americans.
