                    <h2>✡ Pisces ✡</h2>
                    <p>
                        Pisces is the last horoscope sign of the list. Very complex things which are inaccessible to
                        the ordinary man are united under energies of this sign. Pisces sometimes can poorly understand
                        themselves, not to mention others. Any planet in Pisces sign makes understanding the function of the
                        planet difficult.</p>
                    <p>The symbol of the sign is two Pisces swimming in opposite directions, which symbolise the highest and
                        the lowest principles of a man. Low Pisces likes muddy water, feels uncomfortable in the clean and
                        always tries to find the muddiest place. On the contrary, High Pisces languishes and suffocates in
                        muddy water. Lower Pisces influenced by Neptune that is reflected in a strong distortion of the perception of
                        the world, variable phobias, a tendency to self deception and the ability to live simultaneously
                        in several realities. Such Pisces are able to demonstrate the most vile human qualities. There
                        are many people addicted to alcohol and drugs among Pisces. According to statistics in Europe there
                        are 38% of alcoholics among Pisces. Controverse, the sign of opposition Virgo gives the biggest
                        sober-drinkers - it’s only 2.8 percent of alcoholics among them. The features of High Pisces are
                        kindness, indness, wisdom, self-sacrifice, justice, honesty, subtle intuition and patience. Such
                        Pisces do not accept injustice and they are always ready to help. Such Pisces can strongly influence the
                        people and situations around them, and this happens by itself, unobtrusively and imperceptibly
                        to others.</p>
                    <P> Pisces are evasive and mysterious persons. Their nature is vulnerable and sensitive. Sometimes they
                        have lack of vitality. Any violence can hurt them hardly. Many Pisces are sacrificial and dreamy.
                        ️Besides the sacrifice and dreaminess, Pisces have absolutely incredible flexibility, subtle
                        sensitivity to all living things, as well as to subtle worlds, and rich imagination. However, at
                        the same time, they can intuitively follow the flow of life in incredibly right direction for
                        them, bypassing the rapids and hidden currents. </p>
                    <p>
                        Subtle mental organization gives a special sensitivity to the art of any kind. Also they are
                        generously willing to share with others all their knowledge. Music has a very strong impact on
                        them. There are a lot of musicians among Pisces: Bach, Handel, Rossini, Vivaldi, Rimsky-Korsakov
                        and many others. Despite all the contradictions of this sign, Pisces are incredibly wise and spiritual people who can
                        have incredible intuitive insights.
