                    <h2>✡ Leo ✡</h2>
                    <p>
                        What is the the first image comes to your mind when you hear the word “LEO”? That's right, the
                        king or a big cat. Leo belongs to the element of Fire. A sign that represents the will and
                        taste of life. Leo is able to wait, patient, has a sense of self-esteem. The most important
                        feature is determination. Leo is the sunny sign of actors because of The Sun which is the ruling
                        planet. It leads them having a strong desire to show themselves.
                    </p>
                    <p>Despite their autonomy of
                        personality, Leo can not imagine themselves without friends or communication. Leo suffers very
                        much
                        when they are not noticed, because the attention to them is very important. They need the
                        adoration coming from their surroundings, that is why they usually have a lot of friends. It is
                        important for Leo that you mark something unusual in them, which other people do not have!
                        Moreover, they will constantly talk you about it and show it. The only things that will forever
                        push the Leo away from you are pettiness and hypocrisy. Leo will
                        never understand how it is possible to do something behind his back. Therefore they keeps away
                        from such people. </p>
                    <p>There are 2 types of Leo evolutions: the Lower and the Higher. The Higher is
                        warmth, kindness and generosity. The Lower: Napoleon's complex and narcissism (selfies were
                        invented by Leo ). The task of each Leo is to suppress bad qualities of the Sun, for example,
                        vanity. If you see a man who lists all his regalia and awards every day, you have met the Lower
                        Leo. There are a lot of Leos among celebrities⛤. The High Leo does not brag and does not talk
                        about the achievements. Such kind of people need someone nearby who would be led by them or some
                        structure, a system that could be changed by them. When there is something need to be organized,
                        enhanced or there is a situation that must be mobilized and rationalized, Leo becomes very
                        powerful.</p>
                    <p> Leo since the childhood is very independent and organized and they do not need to be controlled.
                        Children love Leos, because it can be explained quite simply. First, Leo attitude to a child is
                        the same it is to an adult. They are spectators who need Leo's attention. Thus Leo will
                        definitely pay attention and get
                        pleasure from it! And children can feel when adults are treating them well! Secondly, Leo can
                        become very inventive and sincere when they are playing with children! They do not get tired,
                        but rather very proud that the children appreciate their ideas.
