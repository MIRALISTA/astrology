                    <h2>✡ Taurus ✡</h2>
                    <p> Taurus is the second of the 12 signs of the zodiac. Element: Earth. That is the flesh of our
                        whole world. It is the material basis which organizes the activities of the other three
                        elements. Ruling Planet: Venus⚢. Taureans always look representative and are usually taller than
                        others. People of this sign seem to be restrained, calm and slow like they live in their own
                        world and the rest of world is not interesting for them. They are great lovers of comfort and
                        expensive things.</p>            
                    <p>They have really excellent qualities: a sense of taste, love of beauty and aesthetics. Taurus
                        and money are always nearby. They know how to make money, and money likes Taurus
                        too.Taureans’ house is their fortress. Taureans equip their home with great love. And the
                        more money they have, the more luxurious their home will be. Taurus is also a good family man,
                        loyal and devoted to his family. People of this sign are very hospitable, like to treat guests
                        with expensive wines.</p>
                    <p>But there are two Taureans’ extremes. One of them is creative, divine bull that creates gold
                    around. And the second is the Minotaur (the Minotaur is a mythical scary creature with a
                    human body and a bull's head). Taurus can be very patient for a long time while being in crisis
                    situations or in the situation when he doesn't like something. But if you bring the Taureans of
                    their wrath, they can be so powerful that it is better not to see it! They become furious and
                    instead of an intelligent, respectable person the Minotaur can appear which easily will swallow
                    you. If Taureans get sick, the best way to recover is to go to nature. Nature and fresh air heals
                    them magically.</P>
                    <p>This is one of the most hardy and stubborn of the signs. The more they suffer and fate, the
                        stronger physically and mentally they become. Career is moving slowly, but steadily, not seeking
                        for easy ways. And eventually they will have big success.
