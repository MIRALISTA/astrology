                    <h2>✡ Saggitarius ✡</h2>
                  <p>Sagittarius is the most optimistic and the most generous horoscope sign. It is named in honor
                    of the Greek myth of the centaur Chiron. Centaur (half-human-half-breed) was the 1st, strong and
                    wise teacher of all the famous heroes of Greece: Hercules, Achilles, Jason, Orpheus, Aesculapius
                    and many others. He told his students about the structure of the world, the origin of all
                    things, about music and herbs, as well as the benefits of a healthy lifestyle. Like the
                    prototype of the sign centaur Chiron, Sagittarius has an irrepressible thirst to share knowledge and bring
                    everyone into a better future (with their, of course, position of a wise guru). An expansion
                    in all senses is very important for them. Their life does not make sense without adventure and
                    adventurism.</p>
                <p>Sagittarius is a fighter for social justice, personal and spiritual freedom striving for a nice
                    future. They are often misunderstood, accused of idealism and utopianism. However, in fact, it
                    is isn’t like that. Of course, there can be failures in their lives, but it does not discourage
                    them, because they clearly know that after the dark strip of life a light strip come. There are
                    mostly optimists and people with a good sense of humor among Sagittarius. Sagittarius are great travelers and
                    explorers. They are attracted by new countries, new people and new experiences. Only the
                    problem is that all of them are directed somewhere in far beyond the horizons, and can not see
                    what is close and in front of their nose, because they don’t pay attention to the little things.
                    Therefore, close Sagittarius can often suffer from a lack of attention. Sagittarius are not the best psychologists,
                    because they rarely get stuck on problems. It is rarely possible you can talk heart to heart
                    with them. However, you can suddenly go with them anywhere in the world one day. </p>
                <P> Sagittariuses are teachers, thinkers, and mentors. Despite the cheerful personality, introverts and
                    phlegmatics are still more common among the Sagittarius. Sagittarius are divided into 2 types: a secular with an
                    independent mindset, extravagant, original, well-educated with persistent ideas. Among these are
                    many journalists. She loves art, books, nature, animals.</p>
