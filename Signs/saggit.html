            <h2>✡ Saggitarius ✡</h2>
            <p>Sagittarius is the most optimistic and the most generous horoscope sign. It is named in honor
                of the Greek myth of the centaur Chiron. Centaur (half-human-half-breed) was the 1st, strong and
                wise teacher of all the famous heroes of Greece: Hercules, Achilles, Jason, Orpheus, Aesculapius
                and many others. He told his students about the structure of the world, the origin of all
                things, about music and herbs, as well as the benefits of a healthy lifestyle. Like the
                prototype of the sign centaur Chiron, Sagittarius has an irrepressible thirst to share knowledge and
                bring everyone into a better future (with their, of course, position of a wise guru). An expansion
                in all senses is very important for them. Their life does not make sense without adventure and
                adventurism.</p>
            <p>Sagittarius is a fighter for social justice, personal and spiritual freedom striving for a nice
                future. They are often misunderstood, accused of idealism and utopianism. However, in fact, it
                is isn’t like that. Of course, there can be failures in their lives, but it does not discourage
                them, because they clearly know that after the dark strip of life a light strip come. There are
                mostly optimists and people with a good sense of humor among Sagittarius. Sagittariuses are great
                travelers and explorers. They are attracted by new countries, new people and new experiences. Only the
                problem is that all of them are directed somewhere in far beyond the horizons, and can not see
                what is close and in front of their nose, because they don’t pay attention to the little things.
                Therefore, close Sagittarius can often suffer from a lack of attention. Sagittarius is not the best
                psychologists, because they rarely get stuck on problems. It is rarely possible you can talk heart to
                heart
                with them. However, you can suddenly go with them anywhere in the world one day. </p>
            <P> Sagittariuses are teachers, thinkers, and mentors. Despite the cheerful personality, introverts and
                phlegmatics are still more common among the Sagittarius. Sagittariuses are divided into 2 types: a
                secular with an independent mindset, extravagant, original, well-educated with persistent ideas. Among these are
                many journalists. She loves art, books, nature, animals.</p>
            <p>The second type is a girl-boy who is keen on sports, dancing, traveling, music (quite often it is informal music).
                Freedom and personal space are very important for such a girl, and she doesn’t think about marriage.</p>
                <p>Saggitarius men are like a bright holiday, a ray of the sun among the clouds of being. They are generous and
                noble, intelligent and romantic, optimistic and economic. However, there is one trouble - a male Saggitarius can
                not belong to only one woman - indeed, there are so many interesting things around! They are usually
                good speakers. A strong desire for personal freedom in Saggitarius appears immediately, as soon as somebody makes
                an attempt to limit it.</p>
