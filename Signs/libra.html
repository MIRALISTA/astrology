                                      <h2>✡ Libra ✡</h2>
                        <p>
                            The main features of Librasign are the love of justice and establishment of equilibrium. They
                            are the main negotiators and diplomats of the zodiac. They are perfectly able to control
                            themselves.
                        </p>
                        <p> It is considered wrongly that Libras do not have their own opinion. In fact, they can be very
                            fundamental. Libra has their own understanding of things, rules and point of view. They are able
                            to compromise, but only in those issues that are not principle for them. Libra can set their
                            point of view tactfully, but never not by swearing. That's why they're diplomats.</p>
                        <p> Libras usually have nice manners, sense of taste and erudition. They are extremely selective in
                            communication. For example, they will not talk to anybody, but at the same time they are very
                            focused on partnership and friends. For them only the opinions of their friends are important.
                            They don’t care about what others say. </p>
                        <p> Libra can get sick if they don’t get noticed by others.There is no more demanding women in
                            relationship than Libra. She needs attention, kindness and many others things. However, she is
                            able to not paying attention to imperfections of her partner and do not say anything about it,
                            but silence has its limits. And if nothing changes, she will explode. It is impossible to find a
                            better partner than Libra. This is the most relationship-oriented horoscope sign which
                            symbolizes the 7th house of horoscope (the house of partnership and marriage).
                            They are unique for their elusive charm of aristocracy and endurance.
