                    <h2>✡ Cancer ✡</h2>
                    <p>
                        For the people of Cancer there are 2 worlds - their own and other people’s. It is difficult to
                        understand what is on their mind and soul. Sometimes they are quite closed. But at the same time
                        they are amazingly disciplined and serious in everyday matters. Despite the seeming softness  and sensitiveness, cancers are quite powerful people. They like to keep everything under their
                        control. In usual life they may have a lot of doubts, but during periods of crisis they are able
                        to fight to protect their friends who were hurt. So they can show themselves as strong people in
                        extreme situations. 
                     </p>
                    <p>Cancer knows how to communicate with different people. Any abrupt situation
                        amongst their beloved ones is very traumatic for Cancers. Cancer is afraid of freedom. They love being
                        dependent on other people. It's quite difficult to get close, make friends with a typical
                        Cancer, because they often are closed and it is hard to gain their trust. ✔ Cancers are not one
                        of those who immediately become friends just after meeting people. All friends are time-tested.
                        Therefore they usually have not many friends. But if Cancers let someone come into their life,
                        they will take care of this person for the rest of their life.</p>
                        <P> Cancers often have an anxious psyche, they are always emotional and can passionately empathize
                            with other people's troubles. Also cancers have a well-developed intuition</P>
                    <P> Cancer woman is more emotional, it is more difficult for her to control the emotions. It is
                        important for her to see the love of people that she loves. Representatives of this sign of the
                        zodiac put family happiness at the forefront. They become excellent wives and mothers, who are
                        sensitive and loving.</P>

                    <p>Cancer man is ready to work hard. He knows how to set goals and achieve them with minimal energy. It is important for him to have a comfortable environment,
                        because his mood changes rapidly depending on the behavior and words from colleagues and loved
                        ones.
