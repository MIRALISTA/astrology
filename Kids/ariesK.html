            <h2>✡ Aries child✡</h2>
            <p>If you have an Aries child you should pay more attention where is he/she is and what he/she does. These
                children who
                don’t have any fear and feelings of self-preservation can do a lot of trouble. They are devoted
                to novelty and there is nothing impossible for them. Aries children should not be ignored if the
                they break into a cry, because if it happens, they really have good reason for it.
                Aries children are the children of "Fire". So it isn’t for them to sit quietly, examine the
                pictures, being engaged in passive games. From childhood they are very active and can’t stop
                even for a minute! So it is good to engage them to any sport from an early age. It will help
                kids get rid of their excessive energy. If you don’t help them to unload their psyche with
                physical exercises, it will reach the point that such a child can get ill. It would be good, if
                it was a professional sports section, because there are lot of professional Aries- athletes.
            </p>
            <p>In spite of their hyperactivity, unique energy, unfortunately, Aries children aren’t
                persistent. So these children need to be constantly checked. Try not to berate such a child and
                patiently deal with them. Entice them with something new, explaining to them why some things are
                necessary. You should teach them to finish what they started. For an Aries child discipline is
                very important. Aries children, especially boys can be quite aggressive. But never respond to
                and Aries child aggressively. Because it can make them even more aggressive . Aries children are
                afraid of not being loved. They understand everything literally. So, if you show aggression,
                they will take it as a dislike.</p>
            <p>With such a child, you need to talk firmly, persistently, but gently. And you should show by
                your own example that aggression isn't the way to achieve anything. Talk more with such a child,
                explain to them that in order to be a leader it is not necessary to be stronger physically
                and get involved in physical fights, it's important to have high intellectual ability too.</p>
            <p>You can be sure that if you spend quality time with an Aries minor patiently, your work will be
                appreciated. In the end you can be proud of your gorgeous, successful Aries adult with whom
                you’ll have good communication.
