                    <h2>✡ Aries ✡</h2>
                    <p>If you have an Aries child you should pay more attention where is he/she is and what he/she does. These children who
                        don’t have any fear and feelings of self-preservation can do a lot of trouble. They are devoted
                        to novelty and there is nothing impossible for them. Aries children should not be ignored if the
                        they break into a cry, because if it happens, they really have good reason for it.
                        Aries children are the children of fire. So it isn’t for them to sit quietly, examine the
                        pictures, being engaged in passive games. From childhood they are very active and can’t stop
                        even for a minute! So it is good to engage them to any sport from an early age. It will help
                        kids get rid of their excessive energy. If you don’t help them to unload their psyche with
                        physical exercises, it will reach the point that such a child can get ill. It would be good, if
                        it was a professional sports section, because there are lot of professional Aries- athletes.
                    </p>
                    <p>In spite of their hyperactivity, unique energy, unfortunately, Aries children aren’t
                            persistent. So these children need to be constantly checked. Try not to berate such a child and
                            patiently deal with them. Entice them with something new, explaining to them why some things are
                            necessary. You should teach them to finish what they started. For an Aries child discipline is
                            very important. Aries children, especially boys can be quite aggressive. But never respond to
                            and Aries child aggressively. Because it can make them even more aggressive . Aries children are
                            afraid of not being loved. They understand everything literally. So, if you show aggression,
                            they will take it as a dislike.</p>
                    <P>With such a child, you need to talk firmly, persistently, but gently. And you should show by
                            your own example that aggression isn't the way to achieve anything. Talk more with such a child,
                            explain to him/her that in order to be a leader it is not necessary to be stronger physically
                            and get involved in physical fights, it's important to have high intellectual ability too.</P>

                    <p>You can be sure that if you spend quality time with an Aries minor patiently, your work will be
                        appreciated. In the end you can be proud of your gorgeous, successful Aries adult with whom
                        you’ll have good communication.
