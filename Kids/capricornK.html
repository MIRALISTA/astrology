            <h2>✡ Capricorn child ✡</h2>
            <p>
                Infants of Capricorn sign do not give parents unnecessary worries. They can lie quietly for hours, even
                if the diapers are soaked. Capricorn does not require much attention. If they are feed with
                something tasty, it is nice, if they are given with ordinary food, it is also not bad for them.
                They are happy with those toys that were bought a few months ago and don't need something new
                every day.</p>
            <p>️Little Capricorns being the children of Saturn can look at the world rather pessimistically.
                They have a suffering, dreamy, mystical soul. ️Advice to parents - talk more with your little Capricorn,
                ask about their life, what is interesting for
                them, what causes emotional discomfort for them. A Capricorn child should know that they will always be
                listened to, understood and helped. Otherwise, if there was no good relationship in childhood,
                such a child in adolescence may become very closed. If Capricorn decided to share with you some
                information, never turn this information against them, even if the information shocked you. Make
                a dialogue with Capricorn - they need it more than anyone else. Particular attention should be paid to
                youthful years. The fact that parents did not notice psychological problems can lead to
                tragedies. As Capricorn child has the quite pessimistic nature it lead that there are a lot of
                children’s
                suicides among Capricorn. Depression is perhaps one of the main and leading features of Capricorn.
                Emotionally, children are not stable. Therefore, you need to pay attention to their
                psychological background carefully. Try to become a friend for your child, look for an approach
                to them. Considering the fact that such a child a pessimist is from their birth, the atmosphere
                in the house should be smiling, joyful and harmonious. It will gives strength and optimism to
                such a child. ️It is no needed to drive Capricorn child guests, force them to read poetry in public, to
                play group games,
                if they don’t want to do this - this is not the natural environment of the little </p>
            <p>The early years are often difficult and full of struggle for them. Capricorn adults are very
                serious, practical, agile and stubborn in achieving their goal. They are very disciplined and
                require the same from others. Capricorn are professionals in what they do,
                but they can be terribly meticulous and boring. They can bring freedom-loved and informal
                Aquarius or Sagittarius to a nervous tic, while not paying attention to their feelings, because
                the rules exist to follow them! </p>
            <P> Capricorns are prudent, economical (these qualities even can turn into greed). Luxurious life is
                not for Capricorn. They love such a lifestyle in order to have a stable, may be small, but guaranteed
                income. They
                will not take a risk, because it can undermine their material well-being. Therefore, they can
                refuse from good business offers and misses their chance, because they are afraid of losing what
                they have. They achieve their goals working hard. They set tasks for themselves that can only be
                solved independently by themselves. The more complicated the goal, the more determined and
                active they are in order to reach it.</p>
            <p>All mental emotions and impulses of Capricornare under strict control. They often have the lack
                of sensuality and tenderness. Capricorn has all these qualities, but they don't demonstrate them
                for public - they have such a nature. They are often shy and sensitive people inside who can
                suddenly fall
                into melancholy, succumb to despair, depression. And they compensate for the lack of sensuality
                with loyalty and reliability.</p>
            <p> Capricorn can be quite slow, but you do not need to make them hurry. Capricorn child is smart, talented
                with a good
                memory. Capricorn child like to read, but they are not capable of quick, decisive action. Therefore,
                they
                just need to help open up. And do not worry that child is slow. They are much faster than other
                signs can reach the goal. There are signs that do everything quickly, but superficially and
                frivolously. And Capricorn may do not so quickly, but confidently and responsibly.</p>
            <p>If Capricorn child for some reason decided that they are not good in a subject at school, it would be
                difficult to change their mind. You need to be patient and try to tactfully explain them that
                everything is possible, they just need to spend more time for studying. The main thing is not to
                laugh at your child if they don't understand something. You need become a friend and helper for
                them.</p>
            <p>Another feature of Capricorn is “small adults”. When you communicate with a small person, talk to them
                as an equal and remember that little Capricorn is an adult inside. And due to that fact, they like to
                communicate with adults. Capricorn would rather sit on the bench with their grandparents, rather than
                run with the children on the playground.</p>
            <p>️You should pay attention to the health of the little Capricorn. Any illness in childhood, starting
                from infancy and up to 14-15 years old, can become a serious chronic problem. Capricorn is not very
                stable for all sorts of illness up to 15 years old. Teach your child to do any sports. This
                will help strengthen their immunity. Show your love, care, attention, patience and you will only be
                proud of your child in adulthood.
