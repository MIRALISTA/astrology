                    <h2>✡ Gemini child ✡</h2>
                    <p>
                        Gemini children are very active and restless, they can not be left for a long time in one place
                        alone. They need an eye-to-eye care, because their inquisitive mind wants to explore the world
                        and is constantly looking for something new and interesting. They tend to any knowledge that
                        is available to them, grab 10 matters at the same time. But it is difficult to concentrate on
                        one thing. Therefore, parents should tactfully in the form of a game to force the child to
                        finish what they started, and then move on to another. It is important to develop perseverance .
                        This system will break the frivolous nature of the little Gemini and lead him to success in
                        adulthood.                              
                    </p>
                    <p> Gemini children are very psyched and have an imagination that works very well. Therefore it is
                            better not to scare these children with some mythical creatures or leave alone in a dark room
                            for punishment. Otherwise in adult life this can turn into a phobia.</p>
                    <p> Parents constantly need to play educational games with children, read scientific and
                            educational literature and teach foreign languages. Try to discourage them from playing computer
                            games, especially before bedtime, because the little Gemini children are very delicate and
                            computer games may have bad influence on them.</p>

                    <p>Also these children are well distinguished when they are told the truth or lied to even in
                            their very young age. Therefore, it is necessary to build a trusting relationship. Talk to your
                            little baby as an adult using simple and accessible language. Love, communicate, read books together and do not suppress such a child with your authority.
                            Then in adulthood you will have a warm, friendly relationship with your Gemini adult.
