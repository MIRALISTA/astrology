            <h2>✡ Cancer child ✡</h2>
            <p>
                All children without exception need attention, care and love. But in particular, Child Cancer
                needs this. children are extremely emotional. They are the most sensitive, the most tender, and
                the most unprotected children of all the signs of the zodiac. They can look at this world with
                great fear and horror.</p>
            <P> Advice to parents: Under no circumstances should the child be
                frightened. He/she is already terrified of this life. Such children often have a sad, mysterious
                look. Girls cry a lot. Therefore, only the words of approval, support and love should be heard
                by such a child. All of your words are deposited in his soul and create his own image about the
                things that you told them. Otherwise, you will break such a child, his psyche will be broken for
                life.
            </P>
            <P> You do not need to scream, scold such a child, because if you frown, it's enough that your
                child understands that he/she did something wrong. In order for the cancer to be more
                independent, give them a task that they must perform themselves (collecting pyramid from cubes,
                collecting something from the design, cleaning the toys, etc.) and then, after that, praise
                them.</P>

            <p>Cancer’s is a fortress for such children, so parents must create this protection. Cancers
                should know that next to them there are their friends, loving parents who will always protect.
                If a does not want to communicate with a person, never force to do it. Communication with
                unloved people has a bad effect on his emotional state, such a child can even get sick
                physically. Such a child came into this life with peace, in order to receive warmth and kindness from
                you.
                You must become a friend for your small cancer and should be very supportive parents. As a
                result, your child will have a very good and happy future.
