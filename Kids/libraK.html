                        <p>
                                Libra children are very sensitive. If you raise  Libra children, you should know that you have at home literally a very
                            fragile "porcelain” that it is easy to destroy. And if parents do not have good attitude to them
                            in childhood, they will carry the consequences of it for whole their life. And it is not rare
                            that their spoiled fate is from the deepest childhood. The first thing you need to know: Libra child does not tolerate loneliness. They are always sad and
                            unhappy when there are no loving parents around and if there is no tactile contact from their
                            mother. The second thing you need to know: your child is a great aesthete from their birth. So it is
                            very important for them that everything around is beautiful and harmonious.                                          
                                                    
                        </p>
                        <p> Also, the  Libra child is very sensitive to the relationship of parents. If parents arguing with each
                                other, show aggression in front of their infant, the Libra child feels this as a personal tragedy. The
                                fact, a nervous system of  Libra child is very sensitive and weak. That is why it is very easy to break
                                it.  You need to understand that any aggression is very painful for Libra. So, if child does something
                                bad, just a simple explanation is enough. Tenderness and affection in this situation is much
                                more effective for such a child than punishment. Believe me, this child is wise from their birth.
                                Libra children understand much more than you think about them. Parents should know that shouting and
                                aggression as a method of education will spoil your relationship with the little child for their
                                whole life.</p>
                        <p>Libra is usually very talented. It can be musical, artistic talent or talent in any other form of
                                art. It is important to notice it in time and start developing it. Do not forget to praise these
                                children. Compliments for Libra is the best way to win, they need it so much.
                                These children are very capable in studying at school. However, quite often it is difficult for
                                them to do homework alone. If the parents do not control them, Libra child can stop doing it. Therefore,
                                it is good to pay more attention to them. </p>
                        <p> Mood changes, which adult child is famous for, are also typical for children.  Libra children can have fun in
                                front of you, but within a second they can start crying. They can not explain themselves what
                                happened to them. You should understand that this is a feature of this sign. Digestive disorders, migraines and lower back pain
                                are a consequence of nervous overload such children. So you should pay attention to it.
                                Advice: talk more with  Libra children, ask about the things that upsets them and about their life. All the
                                problems and the doubts that spoil their mood should be resolved. The atmosphere of kindness in
                                their family is very important for Libra child. The most adequate and successful Libras grow up only in
                                such atmosphere. And remember parents, when you fight and insult each other, it ruins your child's life. It's
                                not worth it!
