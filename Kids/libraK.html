            <h2>✡ Libra child ✡</h2>
            <p>
                Libra children are very sensitive. If you raise Libra children, you should know that you have at home
                literally a very
                fragile "porcelain” that it is easy to destroy. And if parents do not have good attitude to them
                in childhood, they will carry the consequences of it for whole their life. And it is not rare
                that their spoiled fate is from the deepest childhood. The first thing you need to know: Libra child
                does not tolerate loneliness. They are always sad and
                unhappy when there are no loving parents around and if there is no tactile contact from their
                mother. The second thing you need to know: your child is a great aesthete from their birth. So it is
                very important for them that everything around is beautiful and harmonious.

            </p>
            <p> Also, the Libra child is very sensitive to the relationship of parents. If parents arguing with each
                other, show aggression in front of their infant, the Libra child feels this as a personal tragedy. The
                fact, a nervous system of Libra child is very sensitive and weak. That is why it is very easy to break
                it. You need to understand that any aggression is very painful for Libra. So, if child does something
                bad, just a simple explanation is enough. Tenderness and affection in this situation is much
                more effective for such a child than punishment. Believe me, this child is wise from their birth.
                Libra children understand much more than you think about them. Parents should know that shouting and
                aggression as a method of education will spoil your relationship with the little child for their
                whole life.</p>
            <p>Libra is usually very talented. It can be musical, artistic talent or talent in any other form of
                art. It is important to notice it in time and start developing it. Do not forget to praise these
                children. Compliments for Libra is the best way to win, they need it so much.
                These children are very capable in studying at school. However, quite often it is difficult for
                them to do homework alone. If the parents do not control them, Libra child can stop doing it. Therefore,
                it is good to pay more attention to them. </p>
            <p> Mood changes, which adult child is famous for, are also typical for children. Libra children can have
                fun in
                front of you, but within a second they can start crying. They can not explain themselves what
                happened to them. You should understand that this is a feature of this sign. Digestive disorders,
                migraines and lower back pain
                are a consequence of nervous overload such children. So you should pay attention to it.
                Advice: talk more with Libra children, ask about the things that upsets them and about their life. All
                the
                problems and the doubts that spoil their mood should be resolved. The atmosphere of kindness in
                their family is very important for Libra child. The most adequate and successful Libras grow up only in
                such atmosphere. And remember parents, when you fight and insult each other, it ruins your child's life.
                It's
                not worth it!
