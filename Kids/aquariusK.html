            <h2>✡ Aquarius child✡</h2>
            <p> Aquarius child is very stubborn. They have a quick mind, an extraordinary view of the world and
                inherent leadership qualities. Their personality is very controversial. Little Aquarius like to shock
                the public. Their psyche is not stable. So Aquarius can have the mood swings for whole their life.
                Aquarius seem to many people very strange and unlogical. The first people who come across this
                “irrationality” are their parents. It seems to parents of such a child that their Aquarius is always in
                opposition and the child does not want to compromise. The reason for this situation is the fact
                that in most families the model of relationship between parents and children is built like this:
                “You should do as I told you!” or “I’m an adult and, therefore, I’m I know better what's right!
                This model of education doesn't fit little Aquarius. The more parents will push their child and require
                obedience without explanation why this cannot be done, the more little Aquarius will see the enemy in
                the parents and do the opposite. And then it can result in a huge problem in adolescence.
                The Aquarius child is very capable at school, but they are good at that subjects only in which they
                are interested in.️</p>
            <p> The feature of Aquarius children is that they not always can understand what is “bad” and what is
                “good”. Therefore, parents should explain why some actions can not be done and try to create a
                friendly atmosphere at home. Little Aquarius needs people with whom they can share their feelings.
                Therefore, the task for parents to become such people for their child. It will help the little
                Aquarius to build the correct guidelines at the stage of growing up and not become an impulsive
                and stubborn teenager who does not make contact at all. In adolescence, this child can not be
                changed. </p>
            <P> Like all horoscope signs of air, Aquarius has an unstable nervous system. Advice for parents - do
                not push, do not humiliate, do not criticize your child and do not undervalue their ideas, even
                if they seem ridiculous to you - there are a lot of innovators and inventors among Aquarius. Another
                feature of this sign is that small Aquarius need a private space. They need to be alone to
                think and spend time for their hobby. Be sure to give them that opportunity.</p>
            <p> The weak part of body of the small Aquarius are vessels, heart, legs (especially the ankles and lower
                legs). Fresh air, diet, sports are required to improve health. And, despite the fact that there
                are not many athletes among Aquarius, it is definitely good idea to teach a child any sports.
                And remember, when parents raise children, they also raise themselves.</p>
