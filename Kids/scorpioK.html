                    <h2>✡ Scorpio child ✡</h2>
                    <p>
                        Scorpio is one of the most viable, powerful signs. A sense of independence can be very strong even for a
                        little Scorpio. Sophisticated parents can raise honest, open, sincere Scorpio who is a defender of the weak,
                        a wonderful friend and comrade; a real warrior who can overcome any difficulties. On the other
                        hand; parents, who cannot find an approach to their children, can raise Scorpio who are cruel, selfish
                        and avenger. Therefore, parents have a great responsibility in the education of such.                                                              
                    </p>
                    <p>The Scorpio child have qualities of a fighter from birth. The first people with whom the child
                        begins to fight are his/her parents. Quite often, it is difficult to agree with Scorpio and it seems
                        that Scorpio will oppose the parent for any reason. Parents for such child are the first object for
                        the training of fighting qualities which Scorpio considers very important for themselves, without
                        realizing it. Therefore, Scorpio children are in constant confrontation with their parents. The
                        parents, in this case, can feel a strong moral overload when they raise such a child.</p>
                    <p>Scorpios are often aggressive, especially boys. Therefore, the advice to parents- not even a moment of
                        aggression should be unnoticed. For example, it should not be like that: one day Scorpio was punished
                        for aggressive behavior, and the other day it was left unnoticed. If a child offends a friend
                        and behaves aggressively with other children, it is necessary to explain strictly that this
                        cannot be done. As a method to solve this problem you need to deprive such a child of any
                        privileges (prohibit watching cartoons, restricting sweets and etc.). And this should enter
                        the system. The child should be taught that aggression and force should be used only in extreme
                        cases. In contrast to the aggression of the little Scorpio, parents should put their love and a good
                        attitude toward him. Parents should show by their own experience of how to love. </p>
                    <p>Many Scorpios being very suspicious and distrustful, tend to avoid groups. So from early childhood, attach Scorpio to
                        team games. The earlier they begin to interact with different children, the easier it will be
                        for them to adapt to the groups in adult life.</p>
                    <p>Small Scorpio has a feature: if Scorpio wished something, they will achieve it at any cost. It is
                        impossible to change a Scorpio’s mind. Therefore, the advice to parents: from childhood the Scorpio child
                        should have a hobby. Pay attention to what they like. The child should be not forced to do as
                        their parents want, but it is a good idea to send a child in the right direction when it is
                        possible. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Relationships in the family becomes a model for the little Scorpio, and an example of
                        his future relationships. Therefore, never have an argument in front of such child. If there is
                        a quarrel, sort things out when the child does not see it.
                        Show Scorpio your maximum love, patience and direct it imperceptibly in the right direction and then
                        in adult life, it will be an honest, noble and fair Scorpio.
                    </p>
