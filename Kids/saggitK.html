            <h2>✡ Saggitarius child ✡</h2>
            <p>Saggitarius starts to discover the world from their early childhood. They are able to learn
                fast. Saggitarius is very active, sociable, impulsive, determined and quite stubborn. This is a
                feature of all fire horoscope signs. Saggitarius can not stand loneliness. Such a child can consider it
                as a personal tragedy and usually starts crying when they are alone. But Saggitarius feel great in the
                room full of guests -in this situation they are in excellent mood. Therefore, if there is a
                choice to leave the child at home or take them to your friends’ home -be sure to take them with
                you.
            </p>
            <p>Another tip, if you have a small Saggitarius child, it would be great to get an animal at your
                home. Considering the fact that parents cannot always be with the child and the little Saggitarius does
                not tolerate even brief loneliness, it will be easier for the child to bear such moments with their
                pet.</p>
            <p>Taking into consideration the fact that Saggitarius child are very active, they
                should be controlled by their parents all the time. Therefore, It is good to direct the
                hyper-reactivity of the little Saggitarius to the right direction from early childhood. So it is good to
                go hiking with your Saggitarius child, bring them to a sport section - any active leisure activities
                will have
                favorable effect for Saggitarius. </p>
            <p>Saggitarius child needs to communicate with peers for developing their natural leader skills.
                Therefore, Saggitarius should not be limited in communication. But often Saggitariuses are not able to
                understand themselves with whom they can be friends, and from whom it is better to stay away not
                to get into a bad company. The crowd is important for such Saggitarius child, but it is not
                characteristic of
                them to understand the spiritual qualities of their friends. Therefore, Saggitarius admits everyone with
                an
                open soul, therefore others can often use this. </p>
            <p> The Saggitarius child( especially, it concerns boys) is easy to be drawn into various unpleasant
                situations - not because Saggitarius is bad, but because they may be too naive and gullible. Therefore,
                if you want your son or daughter have good friends, invite them to your home. Thus you can see
                friends of your child and can understand if the friendship will lead to smth good. Another
                tip - teach your child reading from early childhood and read with them together. It is good
                idea to buy books with beautiful illustrations. If Saggitarius child loves books, it will develop them
                for
                their whole life. And most important thing that books help to balance Saggitarius’s explosive and
                energetic character.</p>
            <p>Saggitarius child came to know this world and they want to try everything. If Parents does not
                explain what is good and what is bad for them from early childhood (from 1 year to 7 years),
                then very often in adolescence Saggitarius can try smoking, drinking alcohol, drugs and can get into a
                bad
                company. Therefore, parents should understand the importance of control of their little Saggitarius.
                As soon as Saggitarius earns their first money, get independence, they leave the parents’ home. It often
                happens that Saggitarius leaves their home nests very early. </p>
            <p>
                Never lie to your Saggitarius - Saggitarius cannot forgive the lie even for their own parents.
                A properly raised Saggitarius is a wonderful and generous person who are able to take care and
                gently raising their children.</p>
