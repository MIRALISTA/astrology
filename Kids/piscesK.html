                    <h2>✡ Pisces child ✡</h2>
                    <p>
                        The angel-looking baby born under this sign is not really an angel: despite the charming face,
                        they can achieve their goals not by crying like a Aries child, or stubbornness like a Taurus, but with a
                        smile and cute tricks.️ Having barely learned to walk, Pisces begins to live in a magical world of fantasy. If a
                        mother needs to do laundry or cleaning, it is best for her to inflate several balloons, surround
                        the baby with their favorite soft toys, play music and tell the child that they are in a
                        circus. Then the child will not interfere with it.</p>            
                      <p>The most difficult thing in raising Pisces is to teach them to control a certain daily
                        routine, as they tend to eat and sleep only when they like it. The child can have problems with
                        timing. So, little Pisces are often late. Therefore, the child must be organized from early childhood.
                        But don't make your voice higher in order to increase the level of discipline, because then the
                        Pisces child feels danger from you and can become very closed to themselves.
                        Another feature of a small Pisces is that they tend to break away from reality and exist in a
                        world of fictional illusions. From childhood, Pisces must be helped in the selection of clear moral
                        positions: “what is good and what is bad” should be explained by parents clearly. Then in
                        adolescence the Pisces will have less chance getting into bad company.</p>                    
                        
                    <p>These children are often accused of lying. But Pisces do not lie - they just have such a rich
                        imagination that they sometimes confuse fiction with reality. These children think their own
                        way. Therefore, instead of punishing them, it is better to direct their imaginations in a
                        creative direction - let them compose poems, draw or play roles in drama group plays. Try to
                        protect their talents and surround them with your love for as long as possible. Try to provide
                        positive and friendly atmosphere in your home for your Pisces.Teach them to be stable and brave.</p>
                    <P>  Sometimes Pisces child tend to feel unreasonably upset. They are very vulnerable and can cry
                        very often. Raising a child, be softer and more tolerant. Always remember how sensitive they
                        are. Teach your baby to use innate intuition - it will help them in their whole life. Explain
                        that this is a priceless gift that can be well-being developed with skillful handling.</p>
                    <p> Pisces children need your permanent attention and support. Try to do something with your baby
                        and let it become a tradition for you. Surround the child with warmth and love constantly and be
                        tolerant to their sensitivity. All your good feelings will return to you in abundance.
                        Create appropriate conditions for development of your child and your Pisces will have
                        opportunities to become as talented as Elizabeth Taylor, Frideric Chopin, S. Mikhoels, Rudolf
                        Nureyev, George Washington, John Steinbeck, Handel, Victor Hugo, Enrico Caruso, Michelangelo
                        Buonarotti, Albert Einstein, N. Rimsky-Korsakov, Auguste Renoir.
