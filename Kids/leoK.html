            <h2>✡ Leo child ✡</h2>
            <p>
                The Leo child has the feature of a leader from an early age. They are little princes/princesses
                who loudly declare to the world about their individuality. They require a special attitude.
                Advice for parents: First, remember that the little Leo have very ambitious goals and it is
                very painful for them when something is going wrong. Like all signs of fire, leo is not patient. They
                want to get everything at once. If something does not work, it can lead to storm of indignation.
                Therefore, when you raise a Leo child, you should tactfully and slowly, but firmly enough
                explain that life is not only for the desires of Leo, but there are other people who also have their own
                desires. It is not good idea to indulge Leos, because in the future they can turn into a little
                tyrant. Leo children need to be explained that all the gifts of fate should not just be given to
                them because they are so good and worthy of all the gifts, but because they must work hard,
                prove themselves in life and only then receive a reward. ✔Another feature of Leo child is that
                they are very active. Never forbid them to be active because if the energy will not go out and find a
                worthy activity, your child will go hysterics. Leo should be actively loaded physically since
                childhood. So, sport is very useful.
                <p>Your Leo with great discipline. Like all fire signs, such a child can start multiple
                    things at the same time and not finish them until the end. Explain to them that all things
                    need to be brought to an end, encourage them when they finish some tasks.</p>
                <p>Another advice to parents- your Leo child is born with a sense of their own greatness. Such a
                    child has a nature which is very sensitive to criticism. These children are very sensitive.
                    So, even the slightest criticism can make them down. The worst thing you can do is to scold Leo
                    child in front of his friends. This situation will have a bad impact on their mental state. If you
                    need to have a serious conversation with the little lion, do it individually, alone.#leo
                    Parents should understand that it is very easy to break little Leo by just constantly
                    criticising them in an inappropriate manner Complexes from their childhood will harmfully
                    influence all Leo life and it leads to a situation that they can not find themselves in
                    adult life. </p>

                <p>
                    Leo is often difficult to integrate into a new team. All children in a team eventually
                    occupy their place, but a small Leo child can only take the leading place in the team, but this
                    place can already be occupied... As a result, having made several attempts to take this place, but
                    not having such an opportunity, leo child can be withdrawn into himself. leo absolutely does not
                    tolerate loneliness and if a child does not join the team, it will be a great psychological
                    trauma. So if you see your child sitting somewhere in the sandbox alone with a sad look, pay
                    attention to it. Help Leo child to join the team. You can periodically invite all the peers
                    of the lion to visit your home, where Leo child can feel like a host, receiving guests. For
                    him/her it will be very useful. So it will be easier to build relationships with other children and
                    at the same time to reckon with their opinion. Explain to the children that guests should be
                    comfortable in Leo house. Teach your children how to treat their friends, show generosity -
                    the qualities that are characteristics of their nature.
                </p>

                <p>Despite their autonomy of personality, Leo can not imagine themselves without friends or
                    communication. Leo suffers very much when they are not noticed, because the attention to them is
                    very important. They need
                    the adoration coming from their surroundings, that is why they usually have a lot of friends. It
                    is important for Leo that you mark something unusual in them, which other people do not have!
                    Moreover, they will constantly talk you about it and show it. The only things that will
                    forever push the Leo away from you are pettiness and hypocrisy. Leo will never understand how it is
                    possible to do something behind his back. Therefore they keeps
                    away from such people. </p>
                <p>It is also good to have a pet, because communicating with animals, Leo can learn to take care
                    of their neighbors. The more time they spend with an animal, the wider their soul becomes.A
                    Leo child is naturally very generous, fair, and always protects the weak. Develop these qualities in
                    them.</p>
                <p> Leos can become very successful, but you need to work on it. Pay attention to what children
                    are interested in, ask them about their studies, check homework, discipline them and, of
                    course,
                    LOVE!
