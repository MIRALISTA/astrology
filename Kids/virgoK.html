                    <h2>✡ Virgo child ✡</h2>
                    <p>
                        hose parents who have a Virgo child are really happy parents. Virgo child usually behave good, they
                        study well, they pay attention to any kind of information. Since their childhood, Virgo tries to
                        perform well at all task they are given to. These children can absorb huge volumes of
                        information. Therefore, if parents try to develop Virgos, they will show exceptional abilities. Virgo child
                        can often get ill. According to statistics, 90% of such children have problems with the
                        gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, Virgo child need a balanced menu. If Virgo refuses to eat a particular
                        product, it is better not to insist.                                              
                    </p>
                    <p>Virgo children are patient enough and they do not like to complain (including about pain) to their
                            parents. That is why parents should try to be very attentive to what is happening with their
                            children, including emotional state of children. Another weakness of Virgo child is their nervous
                            system. Their psyche is unstable.Virgo child can be either too nervous or, on the contrary, can fall
                            into prostration. They also can suffer from insomnia. </p>
                    <p>Advice for parents: You should Learn how to build trust with Virgo and shouldn’t try to dominate
                            them. If you try to become a friend to your child, Virgo will be able to tell you more, including about
                            her psychological state. It is good to introduce Virgos to any kind of art, such as drawing ✏or
                            music♪♫. Art balances the psyche of little Virgo. Their tendency to a knowledge should be encouraged
                            by parents. Do not economise money for educational games, books. The more the parents are
                            engaged in developing of their children, the more successful they are in adult life. </p>
                    <P> Virgo child are quite shy, they often have low self-esteem, even the most beautiful girls quite often can
                            consider themselves as ugly ducklings. Therefore, if you notice that the child is shy and
                            belittles themselves, you should support and inspire your child and tell them that they are
                            worthy of the best, the most beautiful and intelligent. You must encourage them because 
                            constantly doubt about their capabilities and attractiveness.</P>

                    <p>Little needs tactile contact very much. If they have not seen affection from their parents, then
                        they can become emotionally cold in adult life.Even as a child, Virgo is wise and adult person in
                        their soul, so it is quite simple to find an approach to them. You just need to show love, care,
                        kindness and gentleness.
