                    <h2>✡ Taurus child ✡</h2>
                    <p> Taurus child is a benevolent, but very stubborn child. Such a child persistently learns the
                        world. Unlike other children, he/she can spend hours studying letters, engaging in figures. A
                        Taurus child is very diligent, he/she will not give up the matter until he completes it. Parents
                        are always touched and surprised. But the euphoria of the parents passes when the child begins
                        to show persistence not only about the letters and figures, deciding to try something else. Such
                        a child with the same persistence - will achieve it, and it can be anything not always good as
                        well. And then the parents can face difficulties.</p>                 
                                               
                    <p>Advice to parents: remember that you will not achieve anything, if you use hysterics and screaming! The more aggression parents will show, the
                            more confrontation they will receive from such children. The fact is that along with
                            stubbornness, a sense of justice was born. So with this child only calm dialogue is possible
                            with the explanation to child why is not allowed to do certain things.</p>
                    <p>Taurus cannot get used to something new quite easily. So kindergarten or school can be very stressful for such a child.
                            It is good if the Taurus starts going to school/kindergarten along with the children with whom
                            he is already familiar. Then such a child gets used to a new environment easily.</P>
                    <p>Taurus children have another feature - they are very slow. But If their parents will rush and push
                            them, It will make them nervous and provoke them to make even more mistakes. It is better to
                            plan life in such way that the kid can do everything in his/her own pace. Respect them from the
                            very childhood and let them be themselves. Then, in adulthood, you will have a good, warm,
                            sincere relationship with your still small Taurus.
                    </p>
